                <h2>About Core Activities</h2>
				<p>The Bah√°‚Äô√≠ Faith offers the following core activities:</p>
				<h3>What is a Devotional Gathering?</h3>
                <p>Devotional Gatherings (all ages) bring people of all backgrounds and beliefs together in prayer, song and meditation. They reflect the diverse cultural character of local communities and seek to stimulate meaningful conversations that can lead to action. As worship is linked with acts of service, a unifying spirit begins to permeate the community. Gatherings are held wherever "the mention of God [can] be made."</p>
				<h3>What is a Children‚Äôs Class?</h3>
                <p>Children‚Äôs Classes (ages 5‚Äì11) are for a community‚Äôs youngest and most precious treasures. They provide the early seeds of moral and spiritual education and introduce the oneness of humanity. All of the community‚Äôs children are welcome. These classes help children discover and strengthen their inherent spiritual qualities like kindness, patience and generosity through stories, songs, prayers and art.</p>
				<h3>What is a Junior Youth Group?</h3>
                <p>Junior Youth Groups (ages 12‚Äì14) motivate young people to explore complex issues, consult about neighborhood needs, plan and carry out acts of service and find positive avenues for recreation and artistic expression. Faced with navigating a crucial time in their lives, participants work to build moral clarity for the many decisions they‚Äôll face. Working with mentors called ‚Äúanimators,‚Äù youth from all backgrounds develop a global identity, wisdom, compassion, decision-making skills and a mindset of service to others.</p>
                <h3>What is a Study Circle?</h3>
                <p>Study Circles (ages 15‚Äìadult) are small groups that meet regularly, usually in the home of a group member, to study passages from the Bah√°‚Äô√≠ writings on the life of the soul and such themes as learning about consultation, accompanying one another in service and promoting the arts. This training builds capacity, skills and knowledge for a life of service to the community. Participants come to recognize that they have the power to re-create the world around them.</p>
